This project designed and implemented a fully functional thermostat. The key features include a temperature sensor that accurately responds to changes and an LCD display that shows temperature adjustments in 0.1 degree increments. Users can adjust settings between 50 and 90 degrees using a rotary encoder, with the current setting indicated by LEDs. the system stores settings in EEPROM, ensuring they are retained after a restart. The buzzer also warns if the temperature is too high or low and a servo indicates both the measured and selected temperatures.
